<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This fantastic recipe teaches you how to make fried rice without the usual egg and buckets of oil by using water frying and cornstarch thickened teriyaki sauce.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 small clove garlic, crushed</li>
<li>1 small nob ginger, finely grated</li>
<li>1 tablespoon low-sodium Tamari</li>
<li>2 tablespoons dry sweetener</li>
<li>½ cup water</li>
<li>1 tablespoon cornstarch plus 1 tablespoon water</li>
<li>1 cup frozen or fresh corn</li>
<li>2 carrots, diced</li>
<li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
<li>4 mushrooms, sliced</li>
<li>1 8-ounce can chopped pineapple, or fresh if available</li>
<li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
<li>1 red chile, seeded and diced</li>
<li>½ cup chopped cilantro</li>
<li>1 small head broccoli, diced</li>
<li>2 cups uncooked brown jasmine rice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Give your rice a good wash and then cook it according to package directions or in a rice cooker.</li>
<li>Heat a tablespoon of water over medium-high heat in a nonstick frying pan or wok, until the water begins to simmer. Add the carrots, broccoli, and green onions and cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the mushrooms, corn, pineapple, spinach, chile, and cilantro. Mix together and turn down to medium heat. Add water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time as needed, to keep the vegetables from sticking to the pan.</li>
<li>To prepare the sauce, place the garlic, ginger, tamari, and coconut sugar in a small saucepan. Stir and let it cook for a minute or until the sugar dissolves. Add the ½ cup water.</li>
<li>Mix the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Add the cornstarch mixture to the sauce, stir well, and let it cook and thicken for a further 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Once the rice is cooked, throw it in the pan with the cooked veggies, pour your delicious sauce on top and mix it all through! Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
